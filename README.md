Hi!
My name is Robert Maxwell and I am a self taught Mobile Developer. Halfway through 
college I discovered my passion for programming when I tried to develop a blog from
scratch to showcase my writing ability in hopes of landing a copywriting internship.
From then on I have been honing my skills in the hopes of getting employed and gaining more 
knowledge about mobile design through other engineers. The ability to create is what inspires
me to continue to learn about computer programming and the vast array of subjects that 
accompany programming.
