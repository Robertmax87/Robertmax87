Hi!
My name is Robert Maxwell and I am a self taught Mobile Developer. Halfway through 
college I discovered my passion for programming when I met a few people who were programmers.
From then on I have been honing my skills in the hopes of getting employed and gaining more 
knowledge about mobile design through other engineers.
